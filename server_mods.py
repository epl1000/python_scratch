To modify the video server code so that it waits for the next connection when the client breaks the connection instead of ending, 
we need to place the client connection and video streaming logic inside an outer loop that continuously waits for client 
connections. When the client disconnects, the code will return to the outer loop and wait for the next connection. 
Here's the modified code:

python

# [imports and class definitions here]

# [global variables here]

# [function definitions here]

def receive_command(server_socket):
    # [inner logic of receive_command here]

def main():
    # Create a socket object for command receiving
    server_socket_com = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket_com.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    server_socket_com.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8486))
    server_socket_com.listen(1)

    # Create a socket object for video streaming
    server_socket_vid = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket_vid.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    server_socket_vid.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8485))
    server_socket_vid.listen(1)

    # Open the camera (use 0 for the default camera)
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS, 15)

    while True:
        try:
            # Accept a connection for command receiving
            conn_com, addr1 = server_socket_com.accept()

            # Start thread for receiving commands
            receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive_command, args=(conn_com,))
            receive_thread.daemon = True
            receive_thread.start()

            # Accept a connection for video streaming
            conn, addr = server_socket_vid.accept()

            # Video streaming loop
            while True:
                # [video streaming logic here]
        except socket.error as e:
            # Handle socket error
            print(f"An error occurred while connecting to client: {e}")
            # Clean up the connections and continue waiting for next client
            conn_com.close()
            conn.close()
            continue
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any other unexpected exceptions
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
            # Clean up the connections and continue waiting for next client
            conn_com.close()
            conn.close()
            continue

    # Release the camera and close the server sockets
    cap.release()
    server_socket_com.close()
    server_socket_vid.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Note that I moved the server socket creation and camera opening logic outside the outer loop, and added logic to handle client 
disconnections. Additionally, the receive_command function now takes an extra argument server_socket so that it can operate 
on the correct connection. The main function is now the entry point of the program.
